                                            DAY 3 - PYTHON DATATYPES AND STRING METHODS & FUNCTIONS

Datatype:

int:
ex:
    num = 8
    print(num)

float:Decimal numbers are float values
ex:
    num_2 = 7.89
    num = 6.89
    print(num//2)

string:
-> String is sequence of character that are enclosed in ' ', " ", """ """
-> String is immutable
ex:
    so = ("Python")
    print(so)

Concatination:
-> Here, the (+) operator act as to concatinate more than 2 strings.....
ex:
    print("python"+" "+"langauge")

Indexing:
-> Indexing is used to access the particular char in the string by pass index position value.
-> index start from 0.....
-> we have negative indexing to count positions from last to first...
ex:
    so = "python"
    print(so[5])

Python methods:
1.replace()
2,join()
3.split()
4.count()

1.replace():
-> This method is used to change any substring in that particular string
syntax -> variable_name.replace("old_string","new_string",count)

ex:
    so = "python is a langauge"
    print(so.replace("python","java"))
    print(so)
    print(so.replace("a","A",2))

2.join():
-> This method used to add new substring after each char in the string...
syntax -> "string".join(variable_name)
ex:
    so = "python is a langauge"
    print("-".join(so))

3.split():
-> This method can divide the string into different index into list, based on the string pass by us...
syntax -> variable_name,split('substring')
ex:
    so = "python is a langauge"
    print(so.split(" "))
    print(so.split("is"))

4.count():
-> it is used to count the substring in the particular string and also specify particular range of positions.
syntax -> variable_name.count("substring",start index,end index)
ex:
    so = "python is a langauge"
    print(so.count('a'))
    print(so.count('a',0,11))

string built-in function:
1.len():
-> This will find the length of the string, which is number char present in that string
ex:
    so = "python is a langauge"
    print(len(so))

2.max()
-> it gives you the max char in string
ex:
    so = "python is a langauge"
    print(max(so))

3.min()
-> it gives you the min char in string
ex:
    so = "python"
    print(min(so))
'''

n = input('enter time in 24 hrs: ')
s = n.split(':')
if int(s[0])<=12:
    print(n ,"am")
else:
    print(int(s[0])-12,":",s[1],"pm")
